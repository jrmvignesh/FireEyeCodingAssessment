Description

Create a NodeJS, Scala, or Golang (pick one) application that accomplishes the following:

It should generate all the prime numbers between 1 to X where X is a command line argument to the application
Example for NodeJS: node app.js 100

The prime numbers should be stored in a local Redis instance
Once the prime numbers are generated the application should repeatedly ask the user for a lower and upper bounds (inclusive) on the prime numbers to return along with their sum and mean
Example flow:

$ Enter a lower bound: 3
$ Enter an upper bound: 9
$ Result:
$ Prime numbers: [3, 5, 7]
$ Sum: 15
$ Mean: 5
Include basic unit testing around the core functionality
